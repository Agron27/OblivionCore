# OblivionCore

This group project is part of the Collaborative Games Production module and involves the design and development of a Unity-based computer game. The assignment focuses on creating the initial levels of a game that adheres to the theme of "Ever Increasing Circles", emphasising progressively more complex and engaging gameplay across levels.

The objective is to simulate a professional game development workflow, requiring teamwork, effective project management, and adherence to software development processes. The game must showcase original design, art, and gameplay mechanics while meeting specific requirements such as front-end menus, attract mode, progressive difficulty, and audio-visual integration.
