# OblivionCore

This group project is part of the Collaborative Games Production module and involves the design and development of a Unity-based computer game. The assignment focuses on creating the initial levels of a game that adheres to the theme of "Ever Increasing Circles", emphasising progressively more complex and engaging gameplay across levels.

The objective is to simulate a professional game development workflow, requiring teamwork, effective project management, and adherence to software development processes. The game must showcase original design, art, and gameplay mechanics while meeting specific requirements such as front-end menus, attract mode, progressive difficulty, and audio-visual integration.

Collaborative Structure
Team Workflow:

The project followed an agile-inspired workflow, where the team operated in two-week sprints.
Each team member was required to log a minimum of 5 hours per week dedicated to assigned tasks, ensuring consistent progress and equitable contribution.
Tasks were managed using a collaborative project management system, with clear division of roles and responsibilities.


My Contribution:

Scripting: I was primarily responsible for implementing all game scripts, including gameplay mechanics, front-end menus, attract mode, and progressive difficulty scaling.
